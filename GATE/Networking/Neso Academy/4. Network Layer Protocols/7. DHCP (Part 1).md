- DHCP = Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
- Backstory
  - MAC addresses are configured into the network by the manufacturer and are expected to be unique
  - IP adresses must be unique on any internetwork
  - Most OS'es have a way to manually configure IP information for the host
  - Drawbacks of manual configuration:
    - lot of work to configure all hosts in a large network
    - configuration process is error-prone
   
 - DHCP server is responsible for providing configuration information to nosts
 - atleast one DHCP server for an administrative domain
 - DHCP server maintains a pool of available IP addresses
 - can be local, router or ISP DHCP servers
