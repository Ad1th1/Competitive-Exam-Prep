- Transport Layer PDU = TCP/UDP + port numbers = SEGMENTS
- Port numbers are of 16 bits: 0 - 65535
- well known ports: 0 - 1023
- registered ports: 1024 - 49151
- dynamic or private ports: 49152 - 65535
- Eg: HTTP = 80

- Network Layer =  PACKET = PDU is appended = IP address -> can be IPv4(32 bits in decimal) or IPv6 (128 bits -> hexadecimal)
- either user provides IP address or DNS resolves names into IP addresses

- Data link layer deals with frames -> MAC addresses = 48 bits / hexa = assigned by manufacturers = usually not changed

- destination MAC address is found using ARP protocol. ARP is mapped to IP address

- port address
- finding MAC address corresponding to an IP address

- Functions of ARP protocol:
  - resolve IPv4 addresses to MAC addresses
  - maintain a table of mappings
