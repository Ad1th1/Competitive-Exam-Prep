- ICMP = Internet Control Message Protocol
- supporting protocol in Internet Protocol suite
- used by network devices, including routers, to send error messages and operational information indicating success or failure when communicating with other IP addresses

- Eg 1: destination host unreachable due to link/node failure
- Eg 2: reassembly process failed
- Eg 3: TTL has reached 0 (so datagrams don't cycle forever)
- Eg 4: IP header checksum failed

- typically used for diagnostic or control purposes or generated in response to errors in IP operation
- ICMP errors are directed to the source IP address of the originating packet
- This protocol defines a collection of error messages that are sent back to the source host whenever a router or a host is unable to process an IP packet successfully

- ICMP redirect:
  - info from router to source host
  - with better route information

ICMPv4 packet format:
| type | code | checksum  |
| rest of the header      | (pointer and unused field)
| data section            |
