- ARP maps IP address to a physical address
- RARP = Reverse ARP -> obsolete computer networking protocol used by the client computer to request it's Iv4 address from a computer network, when all it has available is the MAC address

- RARP maps physical to IP address
- possible for device to not know it's own IP address due to insufficient memory availability.
- has been rendered obsolete by Bootstrap protocol and DHCP(Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
- both of which support a greater feature set than RARP
- RARP can't handle subnetting because no subnet masks are sent
