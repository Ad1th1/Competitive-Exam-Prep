- Issues with static routing protocols:
  - does not deal with node or link failure
  - does not consider addition of new nodes or links
  - implies that edge cost cannot change

- Solution = distributed and dynamic protocol
- Two classes of protocols: distance vector and link state

- routing table = static or dynamic
- static table -> manual entries
- dynamic table = updated automatically during change
- routing protocol = combination of rules and procedures that let's routers on the Internet inform each other of changes

- Routing Protocols:
  - Intradomain 
    - distance vector Eg: RIP -> Routing Information Protocol
    - Link state Eg: OSPF -> Open Shortest Path First

  - Interdomain
    - path vector Eg: BGP -> Border Gateway Protocol
