- each node constructs an array containing distances to all other nodes and distributes this vector to it's immediate neighbours
- assumption that each node knows the cost of the link to each of it's directly connected neighbours
- hop count = metric
- also called Bellman-Ford algorithm
- updated every T seconds

Problems:
- fast response to good news & slow response to bad news
