- many computers could share a private IP address
- routers(default gateway) map private addresses into a unique, public IP address using NAT

- NAT = Network Address Translation
- IPv4 address space is not big enough to uniquely address every device connected to the Internet = 2^32
- Network private addresses are described in RFC 1918 and are designed to be used within an organization or site
- private addresses are not routed by Internet routers while public addresses are routed by Internet routers
- private addresses can alleviate IPv4 scarcity, but because they aren't routed by Internet devices, they need to be translated first.
- NAT is the process used to perform such translation
