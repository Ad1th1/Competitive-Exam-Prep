## Synchronous Sequential Circuit
   > easy to design
   > clocked flip-flop acts as memory elements
   > slower
   > status of memory element is affected, only at active edge of clock, if input is changed

## Asynchronous Sequential Circuit
   > difficult to design
   > unclocked flip-flop or time-delay acts as memory elements
   > faster because of lack of clock
   > status of memory element changes with input
