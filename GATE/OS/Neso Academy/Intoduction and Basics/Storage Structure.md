- registers -> cache -> main memory -> small size, expensive but fast -> volatile (loses contents if power is turned off)

> electronic disk -> magnetic disk -> optical disk -> magnetic tapes -> cost per bit increases, access time increases, larger size -> non-volatile (retains contents even when power is removed)

- more RAM -> FASTER
- RAM = main memory
